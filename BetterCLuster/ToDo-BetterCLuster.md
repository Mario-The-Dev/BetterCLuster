# Command Handling System - [STATUS: COMPLETED]
## Improved Command Handling System for BetterCLuster

### 1. Define an interface for your commands:

```csharp
public interface ICommand
{
    void Execute();
}
```

### 2. Implement individual commands as classes that implement the `ICommand` interface. Each command can have its own logic and behavior:

```csharp
public class ListFilesCommand : ICommand
{
    public void Execute()
    {
        // Code to list files
    }
}

public class ListAllFilesCommand : ICommand
{
    public void Execute()
    {
        // Code to list all files
    }
}
```

### 3. Create a command handler class to manage and execute the commands:

```csharp
public class CommandHandler
{
    private Dictionary<string, ICommand> commands;

    public CommandHandler()
    {
        commands = new Dictionary<string, ICommand>
        {
            { "ls", new ListFilesCommand() },
            { "ls -all", new ListAllFilesCommand() }
        };
    }

    public void ExecuteCommand(string input)
    {
        foreach (var command in commands)
        {
            if (input.Contains(command.Key))
            {
                command.Value.Execute();
                return;
            }
        }

        // Handle unknown command
        Console.WriteLine("Unknown command");
    }
}
```

### 4. Finally, in your main program, you can call the `CommandHandler` to execute the appropriate command based on the input:

```csharp
public class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        CommandHandler commandHandler = new CommandHandler();
        
        // Get user input
        string input = GetInputFromUser();

        // Execute command
        commandHandler.ExecuteCommand(input);
    }

    static string GetInputFromUser()
    {
        // Code to get input from the user
    }
}
```
# The Ability to Add Users
Users will have the ability to create mutliple users. This feature will help organzie outputs and inputs such as shortcuts.

# PyPlugs
A Plugin System that takes python scripts as plugins. The Python Scripts can have multiple methods, the user will be prompted to enter which method should be executed.

*Command Syntax*
> pyplug

*Prompts*
> Enter the Python plugin file path:<br>
> Enter the method to execute:
